      "top_issue": "Several scenarios hinge on an unvalidated universal CSER threshold (e.g., CSER<0.30) and causal interpretations (\"echo chamber\", \"alignment drift\") without specifying calibration procedure, task/domain dependence, or error rates; this reads as policy-like prescription rather than evidence-based application.",
      "improvement": "Replace fixed thresholds with a calibration protocol (per-domain baselines, control charts, confidence intervals), and for each scenario define measurable outcomes and evaluation (e.g., echo-chamber detection AUC vs. labeled conversational diversity; organizational KG density gain with exact definition and dataset; open-source case study with reproducible repo selection and ablations; safety claim reframed as hypothesis with retrospective analysis on known drift events)."

      "top_issue": "The section introduces new constructs (e.g., H-CSER) and high-level governance/safety claims without clear operational definitions, data requirements, or linkage to the paper’s demonstrated CSER behavior; it expands scope faster than the evidence supports.",
      "improvement": "For each item, provide (i) formal definition (especially H-CSER), (ii) required observables and instrumentation, (iii) a minimal viable experiment (simulation or real dataset) and success criteria, and (iv) explicit limitations. Recast governance/regulatory-capture and AGI-lab gating as testable monitoring tasks with concrete drift labels or proxy outcomes, and include an implementation sketch (streaming KG updates, windowing, alert logic, human-in-the-loop response)."
    },
    "comparison": "The real_world section is stronger because it is closer to implementable monitoring/analytics use (consortia health metric, org KG pairing, OSS analytics) and includes at least one quantitative claim (3x density gain), whereas the future_oriented section introduces broader socio-technical claims and new metrics with weaker operationalization and evidentiary linkage.",
