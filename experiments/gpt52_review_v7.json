    "summary": "The paper presents a two-agent case study where agents co-evolve a shared knowledge graph over many cycles and proposes CSER (cross-source edge ratio) and a composite score E_v4 to quantify \u201ccross-source emergence.\u201d It reports that persona heterogeneity increases CSER and that disabling a CSER gate does not noticeably harm coding benchmark performance, but the evidence is largely anecdotal and underpowered.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear attempt to operationalize an aspect of multi-agent interaction (cross-source linking) with a simple, interpretable metric (CSER).",
      "The persona-diversity manipulation is a plausible causal lever and, in principle, could support controlled studies of coordination vs. echo-chamber dynamics.",
      "The paper is explicit about being a case study and flags several limitations (N=1 system, small benchmark N), which is directionally good scientific hygiene."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Core claims about \u201cemergence\u201d are not convincingly validated: CSER largely measures mixing between agent-labeled nodes/edges and does not establish that system-level properties are absent from individual agents or that the observed structures are nontrivial beyond what simple interaction protocols induce.",
      "Experimental rigor is insufficient: extremely small sample sizes (e.g., N=5 trials in the benchmark), unclear randomization/controls, no statistical testing, and no evidence that results are robust across seeds, tasks, models, or alternative KG schemas.",
      "Reproducibility is weak as written: key methodological details are missing or incomplete (the metric definitions section is truncated; exact prompts, gating mechanism, KG update rules, and code/data artifacts are not fully specified in the manuscript), making independent replication and auditing difficult."
    ],
    "major_concerns": "The paper\u2019s central construct\u2014\u201cinter-agent emergence\u201d\u2014is not operationalized in a way that distinguishes genuine emergent structure from trivial cross-referencing artifacts of the KG construction process; without stronger baselines, ablations, and multi-run evidence, CSER/E_v4 appear to quantify interaction frequency rather than emergence.",
    "recommendation": "Reject. While the direction (measuring structural properties of multi-agent co-evolving memories) is potentially interesting, the current submission lacks the experimental and methodological rigor required for a top-tier venue: incomplete metric specification, underpowered evaluations, insufficient baselines/ablations, and weak evidence that the proposed metrics capture emergence rather than superficial cross-linking."
