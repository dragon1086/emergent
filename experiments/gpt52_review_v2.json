    "key_issues": [
      "External validity remains weak: results are demonstrated on a single, relatively simple task (GCD) with limited conditions (N=4) and no same-persona control; claims about emergent patterns and gating utility therefore remain only suggestive despite improved caveating.",
      "Reproducibility is still constrained by incomplete data release (KG not fully public) and limited detail on the F1-sweep setup (e.g., dataset size, class balance, confidence intervals) and bootstrap/CV procedure (folding scheme, leakage controls), which are necessary to verify the threshold and weight-justification claims."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Clearer conceptual hygiene: separating CSER_measure from CSER_gate resolves a major ambiguity and improves interpretability of the gating mechanism.",
      "Formalization is substantially improved (explicit definitions for CSER, DCI, composite E_v4, PES; H-CSER and MVE protocol), enabling more precise critique and future replication.",
      "Improved claim proportionality and transparency: replacing over-strong language, adding explicit limitations, and providing a calibration protocol and README materially increase scientific credibility."
    ],
    "overall_comment": "The revision meaningfully addresses prior internal-consistency and overclaiming concerns: the metric/gate separation, explicit threshold rationale, and formal definitions make the framework more coherent and testable. However, the empirical base is still too narrow to support broad conclusions about emergent patterns in two-agent KG evolution or general gating efficacy. The paper would benefit from (i) at least one additional task with different structure/complexity, (ii) a same-persona or single-agent control to isolate the effect attributed to cross-source interaction, and (iii) stronger reproducibility artifacts (public KG or a fully synthetic surrogate; full specification of sweeps/bootstraps/CV and uncertainty reporting). As it stands, it is a promising exploratory study with improved rigor but not yet at the level of a definitive methodological contribution.",
