      "Small sample size (N=1 system, 2 agents) limits the statistical generalizability of the findings.",
      "Ceiling effects in the selected benchmark tasks (GCD, LRU Cache) make it difficult to observe a granular correlation between CSER and code quality above the binary gate.",
      "The definition of 'emergence' is somewhat self-referential, as it is measured by metrics (Ev4, PES) specifically designed to capture the observed phenomena.",
      "The 0.30 CSER threshold, while F1-optimized, is derived from a narrow experimental context and requires broader validation."

      "Innovative shift from performance-centric multi-agent evaluation to structural interaction analysis using Knowledge Graphs.",
      "Rigorous longitudinal tracking over 89 cycles, providing rare data on AI-AI co-evolutionary dynamics.",
      "Strong experimental design using persona-diversity as a control variable to demonstrate echo-chamber formation (Condition B_full).",
      "Sophisticated conceptual framework addressing complex system properties like retroactive grounding (D-064) and observer non-independence (D-047).",
      "Excellent clarity in defining metrics (CSER, DCI, PES) and their mathematical derivations."
    ],
    "overall_comment": "This paper presents a highly original and mathematically grounded framework for quantifying interaction quality in multi-agent systems. By moving beyond simple task-success metrics and focusing on the topology of shared knowledge, the authors provide a novel vocabulary for 'emergence' in AI collaboration. The CSER metric is a particularly intuitive and useful contribution. While the study is limited by its case-study nature and small agent pool, the depth of the longitudinal analysis and the inclusion of cross-provider replication (GPT-4o/Gemini) provide a robust foundation for future research in agentic coordination.",
