      "Condition B remains statistically underpowered due to very low edge-generation frequency (4/20 cycles). This makes CSER comparisons unstable and the bootstrap CI reporting appears inconsistent with the stated point estimate (CSER(B)=0.5000 vs CI [0.325, 0.475]); clarify the resampling unit, statistic definition, and why the CI does not contain the point estimate.",
      "Threshold selection/calibration still risks overfitting to the evaluation set: the F1-optimal threshold CI [0.26, 0.30] with \u03b8=0.30 at the upper bound suggests sensitivity. Provide a pre-registered thresholding rule (e.g., fixed \u03b8=0.30) and report robustness across a grid of \u03b8 with confidence intervals, ideally on a held-out split."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Clearer experimental structure with the CSER_measure/gate split and explicit gating criteria; the gate not being blocked in both conditions is transparently reported.",
      "Improved task coverage (adds QuickSort O(n log n)) and release of a synthetic KG subset plus metric implementations materially improves verifiability.",
      "Claim proportionality is good: Condition B is labeled inconclusive and the absence of an echo-chamber effect at this scale is reported cautiously."
    ],
    "overall_comment": "V3 meaningfully improves transparency and reproducibility relative to prior versions (synthetic KG subset, metric code, clearer definitions, and broader task set). The main remaining weakness is inferential: the new Condition B control is informative but too sparse in edge creation to support strong conclusions, and the reported bootstrap CI needs reconciliation with the point estimate and the exact bootstrap procedure. Threshold calibration is better specified but still appears close to a boundary; robustness and/or a fixed pre-registered threshold would strengthen credibility. With these clarifications and minor additional analyses (not necessarily new data), the paper is close to publishable.",
