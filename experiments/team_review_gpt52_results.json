        "CSER is positioned as a collaboration-quality metric and also used as a hard execution gate, but the paper does not provide sufficient theoretical justification, sensitivity analysis across tasks/domains, or a clear causal argument that low CSER should block execution rather than trigger mitigation; the stated Monte Carlo valid range [0.30,0.40] conflicts with presenting 0.30 as an empirically validated binary cutoff.",
        "Core constructs (PES for D-063, DCI, edge_span, node_age_div, and the detect_retroactive() algorithm with span=160) are insufficiently specified for independent verification: missing formal definitions, parameter rationales, ablations, and error analyses; E_v4 weighting appears ad hoc without optimization procedure or robustness checks.",
        "Evidence for generality is overstated: multi-LLM replication reported as 5/5 and bootstrap pass_rate=1.0000 suggests either an overly permissive success criterion or a narrow experimental setup; the paper lacks details on datasets, prompts/agent policies, random seeds, and failure cases, making the strength of the replication claim hard to assess."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear attempt to operationalize multi-agent knowledge-graph evolution with quantitative metrics (CSER, E_v4) and explicit cycle/node/edge counts, which is a useful direction for making agent collaboration measurable.",
        "Inclusion of multiple validation modalities (bootstrap and Monte Carlo) and cross-model testing indicates awareness of robustness and replicability concerns, even if reporting is currently incomplete.",
        "The emergence taxonomy (paradoxical vs retroactive) and the effort to formalize retroactive detection are potentially valuable conceptual contributions if definitions and evaluations are tightened."
      ],
      "overall_comment": "The work is promising in its goal of quantifying emergent structure in two-agent knowledge-graph evolution and in proposing measurable indicators (CSER, E_v4) alongside an emergence taxonomy. However, the current presentation reads more like a metrics proposal with selective empirical support than a fully substantiated methodology paper. The main blockers are (i) under-specified definitions/algorithms and unclear experimental protocol, (ii) a cutoff-based execution gate that is not convincingly justified given the stated threshold uncertainty, and (iii) claims (replication, applicability, and safety relevance) that outpace the evidence provided. With formalization of all metrics and algorithms, preregistered evaluation criteria, ablations for E_v4 weights and span parameters, and transparent reporting of datasets/prompts/seeds and negative results, the paper could reach publishable rigor."
